Move fast and break things isn’t a startup slogan; it’s my life.

I don’t just ideate and ship at speed. I spill at speed. Drop at speed. Forget what I was doing at speed.

That’s dyspraxia: the lag between brain and body, the constant micro-corrections just to stay level. Executive dysfunction in physical form.

Dyspraxia doesn't get campaigns.
There’s no Dyspraxic Thinking™ or DCD Superpowers.
No slogans. No merch. Just effort.

I’m hoping to change that today
I want to talk about a concept I call Dyspraxic Grit.

Psychologist Angela Duckworth calls grit “passion and perseverance for long-term goals.”

That’s grit as choice, something you build, train, strengthen.

Dyspraxic grit is the same thing it’s just forced.
Not optional. Not motivational.
Required. Every day.

You learn it because everything is hard but you have to do it anyway.

You learn it when you’re the last kid to ride a bike, to pass your cycling proficiency, to get your pen licence.
When you can’t catch but you still choose to play cricket.
When you take twice as long to write the essay.
When you stay after PE to practise something no one else thinks about.
When every school report says “he tries hard”. You know it's true but not enough.
You always win the most improved, because when you start doing anything, you’re terrible at it.

You develop it later, when you drop the mug, rewrite the paragraph, retype the email, redo the task.

When you’re the person who turns up to meetings five minutes early because the route, the stairs, and the door handle are all variables.
When you know people think you’re clumsy or distracted, and you show up anyway, polite, professional, determined.

And that’s what I mean by Dyspraxic Grit. It’s the anti-superpower. Every stage it’s learned and earned.

No sparkle, no slogans. Just the steady courage to keep showing up.

Dyspraxic grit isn’t heroic; it’s survival.
It doesn’t make you exceptional it lets you stay ordinary in a world that keeps trying to push you out of ordinary life.

And that quiet endurance shapes something powerful: patience, empathy, a refusal to give up.

It’s intelligence expressed as persistence.

When you give someone the right adjustments,
when you remove the friction, clarify the process, reduce the overload,
it’s like taking the load off an engine that’s been red-lining for years.

The effort, the perseverance, the creativity, all that energy that’s been spent just keeping up, suddenly goes into moving forward.

And then dyspraxic people don’t just cope.

They thrive.

So this dyspraxia awareness week, remember the people who move fast and break things, literally. But also who rebuild, Who persist, Who keep showing up.

Dyslexic Thinking.
ADHD Creativity.
Autistic Precision.

Now Dyspraxic Grit.
