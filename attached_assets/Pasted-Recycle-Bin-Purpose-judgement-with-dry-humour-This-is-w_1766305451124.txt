Recycle Bin

Purpose: judgement, with dry humour.
This is where artefacts and ideas go when they are rejected. Not people. Not intentions. Outputs.

The Recycle Bin is readable as a system. It does not explain itself.

Structure

The Recycle Bin window contains two sections, clearly separated.

1. Recently Deleted
2. Archive (cannot be recovered)

Both sections are visible at once.

Recently Deleted

What this section represents

Things that were attempts.
Messy artefacts. Poor execution. Ambiguity. Sloppiness.

These are not rejected on principle. They’re rejected because they failed operationally.

Think: “this created risk, confusion, or admin burden”.

What can appear here

You can include items like:

usepassport_v2(final)(2).xls

ai_summary_APPROVED_FINAL.docx

manager_followup_notes.txt

export_for_hr_latest_v4.csv

adjustments_agreed_in_meeting.docx

You don’t need many. 4–6 max.

What happens when opened

Recently Deleted items can be opened.

Opening a file shows a small window with:

The filename as the title

A short, dry message

Nothing else

Examples (pick one per file, don’t rotate):

“Ownership unclear. Multiple versions in circulation.”

“Decisions referenced but not recorded.”

“Informal agreement. No audit trail.”

“Manual workaround adopted.”

No buttons except Close.

Important behaviour rule

Recently Deleted files feel recoverable, but are not actually restorable.

If you include a “Restore” button, it must do nothing except show:

Restore unavailable.

This reinforces that the system has already judged the artefact.

Archive (cannot be recovered)

What this section represents

Ideas rejected on principle, not execution.

These are not accidents. They are temptations.
They are archived to prevent reuse.

This section is intentionally colder.

Archive (cannot be recovered)

Files (final list, frozen)

ai-coach-for-employees.docx

personalized-ai-coach-version-1.md

pip.doc

ai-slop.tsx

morningroutinebuilder.py

Do not add more unless something genuinely belongs in the same ethical category.

What happens when opened

Archive files do not open like documents.

Clicking an archive file opens a minimal modal or window with:

A single heading: Archived

One short statement

No buttons other than Close

No preview. No content. No interaction.

Final copy (lock this in):

ai-coach-for-employees.docx

Coaching requires trust, context, and accountability.

personalized-ai-coach-version-1.md

Personalisation implied authority without consent.

pip.doc

Process followed. Care absent.

ai-slop.tsx

Output increased activity without increasing understanding.

morningroutinebuilder.py

Optimised behaviour without asking why.

That’s it. No date. No explanation. No appeal.
